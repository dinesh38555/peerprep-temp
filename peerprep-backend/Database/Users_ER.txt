Relationships:

1. **users → user_progress**  
   - One user can have many progress entries (1-to-many).  
   - `user_progress.user_id` references `users.user_id`.  

2. **users → reflections**  
   - One user can have many reflections (1-to-many).  
   - `reflections.user_id` references `users.user_id` with `ON DELETE CASCADE`.

3. **problems → user_progress**  
   - One problem can be attempted by many users (1-to-many).  
   - `user_progress.problem_id` references `problems.problem_id`.

4. **problems → reflections**  
   - One problem can have many reflections from different users (1-to-many).  
   - `reflections.problem_id` references `problems.problem_id` with `ON DELETE SET NULL`.

Notes:
- `progress_id` in `user_progress` is PK, uniquely identifies each attempt.  
- `reflection_id` in `reflections` is PK, uniquely identifies each reflection.  
- `problem_id` in `reflections` is optional, allowing general reflections.  
- Timestamps (`time_created`, `time_updated`, `created_at`, `updated_at`) track submission and edits automatically.
